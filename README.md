## Collection of issues which you experience working with Gaia data



### Requesting a region using Python

```
from astroquery.gaia import Gaia

ra = 272.96           ## Right ascension of the region
dec = -18.53932068    ## Declination of the region
angle_first = 4       ## Radius of the region in degrees

job = Gaia.launch_job_async("SELECT ra, dec, parallax, parallax_over_error, pmra, pmra_error, pmdec, pmdec_error, l, b FROM gaiadr2.gaia_source WHERE 1=CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS',ra,dec),  CIRCLE('ICRS',"+str(ra) +" , "+str(dec) +" , "+ str(angle_first)+" )) and parallax > 2 and abs(parallax_over_error) > 5")
#  Where abs(l) < 0.1   and abs(b) < 0.1 and parallax > 2 and abs(parallax_over_error) > 4")
r = job.get_results()
print r
```
